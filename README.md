# Sample Project For CSP and Inline Data

Using a Content Security Policy is a great tool to defend yourself against
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This repo contains several examples of how
to / how not to do things.

To run this example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Graham42/sample-csp-with-inline-data.git
cd sample-csp-with-inline-data
npm install
npm start
```

If you're interested in the code I recommend starting in the
[app.js file](./src/app.js)
